              “Those musicians (Ensemble Signal) can show and teach us that
              performing and listening to music — be it old or be it new —
              should become an existential adventure which might open our

            Ensemble Signal builds tailor-made projects in collaboration with
            artists and organizations, bringing a diverse range of contemporary
            music to the broadest possible audience through performance,
            commissioning, recording and education. Signal has realized many
            performance and educational projects that are ideal for replication,
            and is firmly committed to building new projects that encompass a
            wide variety of musical styles, scopes, and sizes.

                Since Ensemble Signal’s inception in 2008, the Ensemble has
                performed over 300 concerts ranging in size and scope, from
                solos to mixed contemporary ensemble, multimedia or video opera
                productions and live ensemble with film. Ensemble Signal is
                flexible in size and instrumentation: we build projects
                consisting of solos to 55 players and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                From the beginning, a core focus of the Ensemble has been
                frequently working in detail with the composers whose works we
                play, in order to produce the most precise possible
                interpretations — among them Steve Reich, Helmut Lachenmann,
                David Lang, Michael Gordon, Julia Wolfe, Hilda Paredes, Georg
                Friedrich Haas, Tristan Perich and Hans Abrahamsen.
              </p>
              <p>
                Signal’s repertoire includes styles ranging from minimalism to
                the iconoclastic avant-garde, to classical. The Ensemble has
                performed projects including the music of Ornette Coleman, or
                J.S. Bach paired with living composers, as well as numerous
                collaborations with contemporary luminaries such as Irvine
                Arditti and Kristian Bezuidenhout.

                  Ensemble Signal’s Steve Reich History and Vision for the
                  Future
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Understanding the immeasurable reach of Reich’s music,
                  Ensemble Signal announces our long-term, multi-year commitment
                  to make our projects of Reich’s music accessible to the
                  broadest possible worldwide audience. With this initiative, we
                  aim to build our impact by reaching new and vast audiences
                  using all of the technology and methods available in the
                  twenty-first century, physically reaching new geographical
                  locations, working with new institutions, and expanding
                  already existing relationships to realize new projects. The
                  performances and documentation we make available will reach a
                  global audience and serve as an educational tool for
                  generations to come. We will carry out this vision through
                  five core approaches: performing, audio recordings, education,
                  on demand video, and live streaming. Our performance projects
                  may include any work by Reich; educational projects include
                  coaching or side-by-side performances of any work by Reich,
                  and community outreach programs. Over the coming years, we
                  intend to move Ensemble Signal toward a fuller realization of
                  this vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Steve Reich has been an essential pillar of Ensemble Signal
                  since our first days, working closely with the ensemble to
                  prepare numerous performances of his work. He even gave us our
                  name: Signal Through our close collaboration with Steve in
                  performing and recording a significant body of his work for
                  almost a decade, the artists of Ensemble Signal have become
                  central members of the next generation of interpreters of his
                  music. For Signal, Steve is not only a composer whose music we
                  love, he is also a mentor and dearest of colleagues.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Signal strives to honor the traditions of performance and
                  production practices established by both Steve Reich and his
                  own ensemble since the 1970s. We also work to naturally
                  bringing our unique next-generation perspective as an
                  ensemble, which includes many young Americans who have grown
                  up listening to Reich’s work as well as the music it
                  influenced - from pop to classical. Additionally, Signal Music
                  Director Brad Lubman brings with him over 20 years of
                  experience at the forefront of Reich’s music, having recorded,
                  performed and given the world premieres of numerous works by
                  Reich internationally.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Signal’s experience with producing Reich’s music is extensive:
                  Signal has in its core repertoire over 20 works by Reich, and
                  has mounted nearly 30 events involving Reich’s work at venues
                  ranging from Lincoln Center Festival and Carnegie Hall to BIG
                  EARS; we’ve given over 150 performances of work by Reich, and
                  released two Reich recordings on harmonia mundi, to widespread
                  critical acclaim. Our performances of Reich have reached
                  worldwide audiences through live streaming on medici.tv, and
                  the number of times a track has been streamed from our
                  recording of Music for 18 Musicians has reached over 2 million
                  streams on Spotify.
