                  Ensemble Signal, described by the New York Times as “one of
                  the most vital groups of its kind,” is a NY-based ensemble
                  dedicated to offering the broadest possible audience access to
                  a diverse range of contemporary works through performance,
                  commissioning, recording, and education. Since its debut in
                  2008, the Ensemble has performed over 300 concerts, has given
                  the NY, world, or US premieres of over 20 works, and
                  co-produced ten recordings.
                </p>
                <div class="drawerContents">
                  <p>
                    Signal was founded by Co-Artistic/Executive Director Lauren
                    Radnofsky and Co-Artistic Director/Conductor Brad Lubman.
                    Called a “new music dream team” (TimeOutNY), Signal
                    regularly performs with Lubman and features a supergroup of
                    independent artists from the modern music scene. Lubman, one
                    of the foremost conductors of modern music and a leading
                    figure in the field for over two decades, is a frequent
                    guest with the world’s most distinguished orchestras and new
                    music ensembles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Signal’s passion for the diverse range of music being
                    written today is a driving force behind their projects. The
                    Ensemble’s repertoire ranges from minimalism or
                    pop-influenced to the iconoclastic European avant-garde.
                    Signal’s projects are carefully conceived through close
                    collaboration with cooperating presenting organizations,
                    composers, and artists. Signal is flexible in size and
                    instrumentation - everything from solo to large ensemble and
                    opera, including film or multimedia, in any possible
                    combination - enabling it to meet the ever-changing demands
                    on the 21st century performing ensemble.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Ensemble is a frequent guest of the finest concert halls
                    and international festivals including Lincoln Center
                    Festival, the Los Angeles Philharmonic’s Series at Walt
                    Disney Concert Hall, BIG EARS Festival, Carnegie Hall's
                    Zankel Hall, Lincoln Center American Songbook, The Library
                    of Congress, Washington Performing Arts, Cal Performances,
                    Tanglewood Music Festival of Contemporary Music, Ojai Music
                    Festival, the Guggenheim Museum (NY), the Wordless Music
                    Series, and the Bang on a Can Marathon. They regularly work
                    directly with nearly all the composers they perform in order
                    to offer the most authentic interpretations, a list that
                    includes Steve Reich, Helmut Lachenmann, Michael Gordon,
                    David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Oliver Knussen and Hans Abrahamsen.

                  <p>
                    Throughout 2017-18, they gave the US premieres of a new work
                    for 19 musicians by Steve Reich entitled <em>Runner</em> at
                    venues across the US. In Spring 2019 Signal performed the
                    world premiere and over 100 performances of a new work for
                    large ensemble by Steve Reich in collaboration with artwork
                    and film by Gerhard Richter at the inaugural season of New
                    York’s new multi-arts venue, The Shed. Signal’s recording of
                    Reich’s <em>Music for 18 Musicians</em> was released in May
                    2015 on harmonia mundi and received a Diapason d’or and
                    appeared on the Billboard Classical Crossover Charts.
                    Additional recordings include a CD &amp; DVD of music by
                    Lachenmann, with the composer as soloist in
                    <em>“…Zwei Gefühle…”</em> (Mode) and Steve Reich’s
                    <em>Double Sextet &amp; Radio Rewrite</em> (harmonia mundi).
                    Signal’s educational activities include community outreach
                    programs in diverse settings as well as workshops with the
                    next generation of composers and performers.

                performing and listening to music — be it old or be it new —
                should become an existential adventure which might open our
                aesthetic and human horizon.”<span class="quoteSource"

              Ensemble Signal builds tailor-made projects in collaboration with
              artists and organizations, bringing a diverse range of
              contemporary music to the broadest possible audience through
              performance, commissioning, recording and education. Signal has
              realized many performance and educational projects that are ideal
              for replication, and is firmly committed to building new projects
              that encompass a wide variety of musical styles, scopes, and
              sizes.

                  Since Ensemble Signal’s inception in 2008, the Ensemble has
                  performed over 300 concerts ranging in size and scope, from
                  solos to mixed contemporary ensemble, multimedia or video
                  opera productions and live ensemble with film. Ensemble Signal
                  is flexible in size and instrumentation: we build projects
                  consisting of solos to 55 players and more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the beginning, a core focus of the Ensemble has been
                  frequently working in detail with the composers whose works we
                  play, in order to produce the most precise possible
                  interpretations — among them Steve Reich, Helmut Lachenmann,
                  David Lang, Michael Gordon, Julia Wolfe, Hilda Paredes, Georg
                  Friedrich Haas, Tristan Perich and Hans Abrahamsen.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Signal’s repertoire includes styles ranging from minimalism to
                  the iconoclastic avant-garde, to classical. The Ensemble has
                  performed projects including the music of Ornette Coleman, or
                  J.S. Bach paired with living composers, as well as numerous
                  collaborations with contemporary luminaries such as Irvine
                  Arditti and Kristian Bezuidenhout.

                    Ensemble Signal’s Steve Reich History and Vision for the
                    Future
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Understanding the immeasurable reach of Reich’s music,
                    Ensemble Signal announces our long-term, multi-year
                    commitment to make our projects of Reich’s music accessible
                    to the broadest possible worldwide audience. With this
                    initiative, we aim to build our impact by reaching new and
                    vast audiences using all of the technology and methods
                    available in the twenty-first century, physically reaching
                    new geographical locations, working with new institutions,
                    and expanding already existing relationships to realize new
                    projects. The performances and documentation we make
                    available will reach a global audience and serve as an
                    educational tool for generations to come. We will carry out
                    this vision through five core approaches: performing, audio
                    recordings, education, on demand video, and live streaming.
                    Our performance projects may include any work by Reich;
                    educational projects include coaching or side-by-side
                    performances of any work by Reich, and community outreach
                    programs. Over the coming years, we intend to move Ensemble
                    Signal toward a fuller realization of this vision.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Steve Reich has been an essential pillar of Ensemble Signal
                    since our first days, working closely with the ensemble to
                    prepare numerous performances of his work. He even gave us
                    our name: Signal Through our close collaboration with Steve
                    in performing and recording a significant body of his work
                    for almost a decade, the artists of Ensemble Signal have
                    become central members of the next generation of
                    interpreters of his music. For Signal, Steve is not only a
                    composer whose music we love, he is also a mentor and
                    dearest of colleagues.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Signal strives to honor the traditions of performance and
                    production practices established by both Steve Reich and his
                    own ensemble since the 1970s. We also work to naturally
                    bringing our unique next-generation perspective as an
                    ensemble, which includes many young Americans who have grown
                    up listening to Reich’s work as well as the music it
                    influenced - from pop to classical. Additionally, Signal
                    Music Director Brad Lubman brings with him over 20 years of
                    experience at the forefront of Reich’s music, having
                    recorded, performed and given the world premieres of
                    numerous works by Reich internationally.

                  <p>
                    Signal’s experience with producing Reich’s music is
                    extensive: Signal has in its core repertoire over 20 works
                    by Reich, and has mounted nearly 30 events involving Reich’s
                    work at venues ranging from Lincoln Center Festival and
                    Carnegie Hall to BIG EARS; we’ve given over 150 performances
                    of work by Reich, and released two Reich recordings on
                    harmonia mundi, to widespread critical acclaim. Our
                    performances of Reich have reached worldwide audiences
                    through live streaming on medici.tv, and the number of times
                    a track has been streamed from our recording of Music for 18
                    Musicians has reached over 2 million streams on Spotify.

                Lubman was the 2017 Composer in Residence at the Grafenegg
                Festival in Austria in his dual role as conductor and composer
                in residence; a highlight of his residency was a performance
                with the Tonkünstler Orchestra Austria, where he led works by
                Brahms and Mahler as well as the world premiere of his own
                <em>Reflections</em> for orchestra. His recent work
                <em>Tangents</em> was commissioned by the LA Philharmonic and
                premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall. In Spring 2020, Rudolf
                Buchbinder will premiere a new work for solo piano by Lubman at
                the Vienna Musikverein as part of a project including 11
                contemporary composers each writing their own variations on
                Diabelli’s theme – which Buchbinder will also record for
                Deutsche Gramaphon and perform live on tour in 2020.
